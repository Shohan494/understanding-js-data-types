## understanding javascript in depth

#### OOP

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

JavaScript is heavily object-oriented. It follows a prototype-based model (as opposed to class-based).

#### Class

In object-oriented programming, a class defines an object's characteristics. Class is a template definition of an object's properties and methods, the "blueprint" from which other more specific instances of the object are drawn.

#### First-class Function
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

#### Prototype-based programming

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, add them to an empty object.
