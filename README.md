## understanding javascript in depth

#### OOP

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

JavaScript is heavily object-oriented. It follows a prototype-based model (as opposed to class-based).

#### First-class Function
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

#### Prototype-based programming

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, add them to an empty object.
