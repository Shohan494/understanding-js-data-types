## understanding javascript in depth

#### OOP

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

JavaScript is heavily object-oriented. It follows a prototype-based model (as opposed to class-based).

#### Object

Object refers to a data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data. Objects sometimes refer to real-world things, for example a car or map object in a racing game. JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and Ruby are examples of object-oriented programming languages.

#### Method

A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kind of methods: Instance Methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or Static Methods which are tasks that can be performed without the need of an object instance.

Note: In JavaScript functions themselves are objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an object reference to a function.


#### Class

In object-oriented programming, a class defines an object's characteristics. Class is a template definition of an object's properties and methods, the "blueprint" from which other more specific instances of the object are drawn.

#### First-class Function
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

#### Prototype-based programming

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, add them to an empty object.

#### API - Application Programming Interfaces

APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
